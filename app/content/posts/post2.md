JavaScript ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced several new features that make coding in JavaScript more powerful and expressive. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the most significant additions to the language, including let and const, arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring.

## let and const

Before ES6, JavaScript had only one way to declare variables: using the `var` keyword. ES6 introduced two new keywords for variable declaration: `let` and `const`.

```js
let mutableVariable = 'I can be changed';
const immutableVariable = 'I cannot be changed';

mutableVariable = 'New value'; // This works
immutableVariable = 'New value'; // This throws an error
