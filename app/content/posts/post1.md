TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers optional static typing, classes, and interfaces, which can help you catch errors early and write more maintainable code.

## Why Use TypeScript?

TypeScript provides several advantages over plain JavaScript:

1. **Static Typing**: TypeScript's static type system helps catch errors at compile time, rather than at runtime.
2. **Improved Tooling**: IDEs like Visual Studio Code provide better autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring support for TypeScript.
3. **Enhanced Readability and Maintainability**: Type annotations make your code easier to understand and maintain.

## Getting Started with TypeScript

To get started with TypeScript, you need to install it:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
